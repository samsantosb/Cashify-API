Cashify API
Cashify is a personal finance management API that allows users to track their income, expenses, and balances. The API is built using a modular architecture, with separate domains for different parts of the application.

Domains
The following domains are included in the Cashify API:

auth: Domain responsible for handling user authentication and authorization.
users: Domain responsible for managing user data and profiles.
expenses: Domain responsible for managing expenses data.
incomes: Domain responsible for managing income data.
balances: Domain responsible for calculating and updating user balances based on income and expenses data.
Each domain includes its own set of routes, controllers, services, and data access objects (DAOs), and communicates with other domains using a message queue.

Architecture
The Cashify API is built using a modular architecture, which allows different domains to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each domain follows the principles of domain-driven design (DDD), with clear separation of concerns and a focus on business logic.

In addition, the API uses a message queue to enable asynchronous communication between different domains. When a user creates a new expense or income, a message is sent to the balances domain to update the user's balance accordingly.
